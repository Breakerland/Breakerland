worlds:
  # Worlds can be handled by templates, based on world type
  # You can override the properties of the template by specifying them in this section
  #    for example 'Title: "My Awesome World"'
  - name: survie_new
    title: "Survie"
    enabled: true
    sendposition: true
    sendhealth: true
  #  # If world isn't contiguous chunks (due to teleporting, for example), fullrender needs to be given other locations to scan for tiles on each patch of chunks
  #  # Use visibilitylimits to restrict which areas of maps on your world to render (zero or more shapes can be defined)
  #  # For a rectangle, the area is defined by x0, z0 to x1, z1
  #  # For a circle, the area is defined by a center at x,z with a radius 'r'
  #  visibilitylimits:
  #    - x0: -1000
  #      z0: -1000
  #      x1: 1000
  #      z1: 1000
  #    - x: -2000
  #      z: -1000
  #      r: 200
  #  # Use hiddenlimits to specifically hide portions of your world (the opposite of visibilitylimits)
  #  # For a rectangle, the area is defined by x0, z0 to x1, z1
  #  # For a circle, the area is defined by a center at x,z with a radius 'r'
  #  hiddenlimits:
  #    - x0: 100
  #      z0: 0
  #      x1: 200
  #      z1: 0
  #    - x: -2000
  #      z: -1000
  #      r: 200
  #  # Use hidestyle to control how hidden-but-existing chunks are to be rendered (air=empty air (same as ungenerated), stone=a flat stone plain, ocean=a flat ocean)
  #  hidestyle: stone
  #   Use 'template: mycustomtemplate' to use the properties specified in the template 'mycustomtemplate' to this world. Default it is set to the environment-name (normal or nether).
  #  template: mycustomtemplate
  #   Rest of comes from template - uncomment to tailor for world specifically
